# Fill the Void
- [Fill the Void](https://github.com/cybervoid/fill-the-void) is an initiative to propel personal understanding of Blockchain technology to an expert level.  

## Repositories
1. *Blockchains* _(general)_ - [VoidChain](https://github.com/cybervoid/VoidChain)
2. *Bitcoin* - [LightningVoid](https://github.com/cybervoid/LightningVoid)
    - This started as an effort to learn more about Lightning network, and quickly became a workspace to explore advanced topics regarding [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
3. *Ethereum* - [RaidenVoid](https://github.com/cybervoid/RaidenVoid)
    - A repository to act as an exploratory playground for better understanding [Ethereum](https://github.com/Ethereum/).
    - **Note: This repository is private, access available upon request**
4. Neo
    1. [cybervoid/awesome-neo](https://github.com/cybervoid/awesome-neo) - When learning more about the Neo project, I made an attempt to contribute to the community by organizing my notes. I realized my notes would be valuable for others so put in a [Pull Request](https://github.com/CityOfZion/awesome-neo/pull/41) to have my notes eventually merged into the [CityOfZion/awesome-neo](https://github.com/CityOfZion/awesome-neo/) project resources repository.
    3. I also attempted to make the primary neo project cross platform compatible. However, I eventually discontinued this effort because an equivalent version of Visual C++ had not been released for Mono/Mac/Unix. This made compiling a necessary dependency impossible on these platforms.
5. Misc
    1. [Cryptography](https://github.com/cybervoid/Cryptography) - I have an on-going repository for learning more about applied cryptography.
    2. Langauges - `I have noticed a pattern with many projects, there are certain languages that keep re-appearing across projects. I took the initiative to learn the fundamentals of these languages`
        1. GoLang - [GoRepository](https://github.com/cybervoid/GoRepository/)
        2. Python - [PythonRepository](https://github.com/cybervoid/PythonRepository)
        3. JavaScript / NodeJS -  [JavaScriptRepository](https://github.com/cybervoid/JavaScriptRepository)
6. [PLightning](https://github.com/cybervoid/PLightning) (in design) - A GoLang project to integrated raspberry Pi and bitcoin lightning Network. This is being done in combination with learning GoLang - see [GoRepository](https://github.com/cybervoid/GoRepository/)
7. [HyperledgerRepository](https://github.com/cybervoid/HyperledgerRepository)(Private, planned) - I've done some work with Hyperledger, but not much due to time constraints.
8. Cardano - (planned)
